# User App

Application that allows managing users and viewing/editing their posts.


## Specifications

All functionalities offered by the application should be protected by authentication.

There is no need to implement server-side, but use data from the (REST API)[https://gorest.co.in/] using the official documentation.

After successful authentication, the user should access the section where they can view the list of users, with the ability to search by name or email. Users should be able to create or delete a new user.

The user of the application must be able to open a user's profile, where their details are shown, along with their posts, and the ability to add comments to those posts.

There should be a second functionality where the user can view all posts, perform searches, and once they find the post of interest, view and add comments. In this section, the user can also add new posts.


## Requirements

### Login
For login, the application should accept a special token generated by accessing (this link)[https://gorest.co.in/consumer/login] through a browser. The token should be used for session management in the Angular application and for invoking the REST APIs via HTTP Bearer Token. For more information, please read the REST API documentation.

### Main page - User list
Display users with basic information. Provide the ability to choose the number of records to display and perform searches. On this page, it should be possible to add or remove a user.

### User detail page
Create a detailed page for each user with all available information. Additionally, on this page, display a list of the user's posts and the comments related to each post.
(Optional) Provide the ability to add comments to each post.

### Post list
Display all posts in the system, with the ability to perform searches. Users should be able to view comments for each post and add new posts as well.

### Testing
Implement unit tests with at least 60% coverage.

### Multi-module and lazy loading (Optional)
The application should be built using multiple modules, with lazy-loading.

### Logout
Provide a logout functionality for the user.


### Use GitHub
Save the code in your public GitHub repository, including a README file explaining all the features of the application, step-by-step instructions for another developer to set up and test the application locally, and all external libraries used.
